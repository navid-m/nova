   - Music playback
   - Audio management
   - Audio file loading (no functions for loading WAV, MP3, OGG, etc.)

2. Animation System: The engine lacks:
   - Animation blending or transitions

3. Scene Management System: Missing features include:
   - Scene hierarchy management
   - Scene serialization/deserialization

4. Advanced UI/HUD System: The engine lacks:
   - Layout managers
   - UI event handling
   - HUD components

5. Advanced Collision Detection: Current limitations:
   - Only supports circle-circle collisions
   - Missing rectangle-rectangle collisions
   - Missing circle-rectangle collisions
   - No polygon collision detection
   - No collision layers/masks

7. Asset Management System: The engine lacks:
   - Resource loading/unloading system
   - Asset caching
   - Asset lifecycle management
   - Support for more texture formats (only PPM currently supported)

8. Scripting System: Missing:
   - Scripting interface (Lua, JavaScript, etc.)
   - Event-driven programming model
   - Component-based scripting

9. Particle System Enhancements: Current system is basic, missing:
   - More complex particle behaviors
   - Particle trails
   - Advanced emission patterns
   - Particle physics interactions

10. Networking Capabilities: The engine lacks:
    - Client-server architecture
